## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to develop a proof of concept for a potential Bikesharing app in Des Moines, IA. This was accomplished by taking publicly available citibike data from  New York City, and creating a data visualization that can be presented to angel investors.

## Results
- Checkout Times for Users: Across genders, folks tend to rent bikes for a duration between four and six hours.
- Checkout Times by Gender: Men tend to rent bicycles for a longer duration than do women.
- Trips by Weekday by Each Hour: The busiest times during the work week are 8AM and 5PM - the prime commuting hours. On the weekend the afternoon is the busiest.
- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): At all hours in the previous example, men rent bicycles at a significantly higher rate.
- User Trips by Gender by Weekday: Across both genders subscribers, rent bikes at a much higher frequency.
- Top Starting Locations: The top starting locations are all near and around Midtown Manhattan.
- Top Finishing Locations: The top finishing locations correlate directly with the top starting locations.


## Summary
It is clear from the data that bikes are taken and dropped off in similar locations, in prime commuter hours, at a rate by men much higher than women. To launch a similar successful business in Des Moines, one would want an advertising campaign targeting working males in the metropolitan Des Moines area. It would also be helpful to understand why ther serivce isn't as used by women in New York City. If one new this answer, this problem could be corrected and open up a larger market for women in Des Moines.
